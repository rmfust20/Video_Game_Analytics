The following is the suggest order of reading through the files:

Functional_Requirements.PDF - This file contains the "business needs" that the database adresses.
ERD_Tables_Only.pdf - This file contains the ER diagrams for only the 3 tables. I'ts not very exciting, but does provide some context for the more complicating view ERD.
ERD_Views_Included.pdf - This file contains the ER diagrams with all of the views aside from reduced_publishers
Video_game_DDL.SQL - This file contains the DDL for the 3 tables in the database, not very exciting since these are basic tables
Data_Engineering.SQL - This file contains information on how the views were created, the most important views being playtime_steam, unique_games, and pc_sales.
Schema_Functional_Depndencies.txt - This file contains information on the functional dependencies in the database.
Queries.SQL - This file contains some of the explaratory analytics that was done through queries.
Database_final.RMD - This file contains the r code that was used to create the r html document (the html document is far more interesting)
Database_final_html.txt - This file contains a link to a webpage that is hosting the output from the r code.
Video Game Analysis Data Report.pdf - This file contains some explanation about the information gained from r such as formatted tables and conclusions.
